		<description>Want a pawn, who's not assigned to hauling, to haul something without having to manually change the assignments for the pawn?
		
Force them to with this mod!

Select any pawn, right click where you want the task to be done, and no more "Not assigned to ____"

Note: If the pawn is incapable of doing a job due to their backstory this mod will still enforce that.

Thanks to "Look at me, I'm the worker now" for the original idea!
